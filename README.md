# Blipper
**Blipper** is a one player game *inspired* by the mobile game **Hitman Go** by Square Enix. It was built as my **first project** on the *Web Development Immersive* course at **General Assembly** using **JavaScript**. A hosted version of **Blipper** can be found [**here**](http://blippergame.herokuapp.com/).

# How to play
You play as Blip Man, a simple *dark blue circle* character who is distinguishable from the rest of the board. Your goal is to use the **up**, **down**, **left** and **right** arrow keys to **navigate him to his target**, the red circle *without being detected* by the enemy arrows.

Arrows have **predictable behaviour** and can only move one of two ways, meaning that you need to study their *turn patterns* and learn from your mistakes in order to learn *the best route* and win the level. 

Players may also restart to try and beat the level in the lowest amount of moves possible for an extra challenge. There are currently **5** levels in total.
