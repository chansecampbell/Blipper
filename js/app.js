////// Survival Game
////// 6 x 6 grid 
////// Player starts at the bottom of the grid
////// You can use the directional keys to move across the grid.
////// There are things in your way that damage your HP - 3 lives and your dead.
////// There are also things on the screen that give you HP back - 3 lives max.
////// Your goal is to strategically make your way across the screen bottom to top and escape the horror house.
///// You either have to be strategic with your moves to survive but you are also rewarded for the less moves you can complete the level within.
